J.A.R.V.I.S is an Administrative helper Discord bot.

GETTING STARTED
You'll need to pull down the development version of discord.py to get it rolling:

python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py[voice]

You may also need the following prerequisites:
apt install libffi-dev
apt install python3.5-dev

Once those are done, you'll need to add the token for your bot account to a file placed in the root directory called 'token.txt'.
